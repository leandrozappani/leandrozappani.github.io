Hi! My name is Leandro.  

I have a degree in Genetics from the National University of Misiones (Argentina). I participated in research projecs from 2013 to 2018 in Plant Cytogenetics.  

My current main reseach interest is the epigenetic determination of the centromere locus.  

I'm a MEXT Scholarship Holder (Government of Japan) and a Research Student at the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences at Osaka University (both positions on hold right now, due to the current COVID-19 situation).
